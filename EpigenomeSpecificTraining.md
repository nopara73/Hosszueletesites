Epigenome Specific Training (EST) aims to restore epigenetic markers of major organ systems of the body. It's called a training regimen, not because it is limited to physical exercise, but because each program aiming to improve upon a specific organ system has training in common. DNA is the code for your traits. Genetics studies how this code is passed on and varies. Epigenetics looks at how the environment changes gene activity without altering the code. This document builds on the assumption that the health of the major organ systems of the body can be assessed by epigenetics with a reasonable error rate.

From a user's point of view it's a few drops of blood: The user would like to improve his health. The user orders a symphony age test kit. The user receives the test kit, gives a few drops of blood and posts the sample. The user waits for the results. Results arrived: knowledge of damage distribution of specific organ systems.

What happens after this is EST. One's next few months are going to be spent of trying to improve one or more organ systems.

# Step 1: Exercise Type Selection

Different types of exercises improve different organ systems. Combine your symphony age report wtih an `exercise type / organ system` truth table. Calculate weigthed effectivities and the best exercises for you will reveal itself.
