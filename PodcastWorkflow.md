## Editing Workflow

0. Set pace to fast
0. Edit the first 5 minutes and the last 5 minutes heavily
0. Manual check through the whole episode around the magic cuts:
   - restore dramatic pauses those were removed by magic editor
   - fix cuts made at the wrong time by magic editor
   - edit repetitions (guest realises he said something wrong and corrects himself)
   - fix obvious grammar errors in transcript (you can fix often misspelled words with a one time change)
   - note interesting parts around 1 minute in length for shorts later
0. If the natural hook is not good enough for the start of the episode, to create an open loop, copy a suitable part of the conversation to start off with
0. Add intro and outro (Gymnop√©die remix)

### Additional for SM (social media)

AI Timestamps, AI Show notes, transcript .srt version

## Short Clips

is this an opportunity for editing?
do not publish bullshit, 73 needs to approve? - Magic clips are bullshit so this needs to be done manually (step no.3 of PACE)
